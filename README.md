# Minesweeper

Welcome to Minesweeper, an app implemented with Kotlin on Android Studio for AIT Budapest's Spring 2022 Mobile Development class.
The gameplay is similar as the original Minesweeper with the following modifications:
- 5x5 game area with 3 mines and 3 flags to plant
- A flagged cell can be unflagged by clicking onto it in "Flag Mode"
- Winning condition: all cells are revealed (or flagged)
- Losing condition: if you hit a mine, the game ends (*it's possible that the first move hits a mine!*)
